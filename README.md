**📊 SQL Data Analysis Project – Toylica Online Retail Case Study**



**📌 Overview**


This SQL project focuses on analyzing the operations of an online retail business, specifically a company called Toylica, which manufactures and sells toy replicas globally. The goal is to leverage SQL to extract meaningful insights from customer orders, payments, employees, and product sales data to improve business decision-making.




**Through this case study, we will:**


Understand the role of databases and DBMS in business operations.

Differentiate between OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) & OLAP (Online Analytical Processing).

Use SQL to analyze real-world business data, including customer transactions, employee records, and sales trends.




**🎯 Project Objectives:**


This project is designed to: ✅ Perform SQL-based data analysis for an e-commerce business.

✅ Explore OLTP vs OLAP and apply them in real-world business contexts.

✅ Query and analyze customer orders, payments, and product sales data.

✅ Generate business insights to enhance sales and marketing strategies.

✅ Build and visualize relationships between different business entities (employees, customers, products).




**🏛 Database Schema & Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**


**📌 ERD Diagram (Entity Relationship Model)**


The database consists of eight interrelated tables, categorized into three sections:


**👥 Employee Section**

employees 📌 (Tracks employee details)

offices 📍 (Stores office locations)


**🛍 Customer Section**

customers 👤 (Details of registered buyers)

orders 📦 (Purchase orders placed by customers)

orderdetails 📜 (Detailed breakdown of each order)

payments 💳 (Tracks transactions and payments)


**🏷 Product Section**

products 📦 (Product information and availability)

productlines 🏭 (Broad product categories)

**🏛️ Database Schema**


The database consists of eight interrelated tables, categorized as follows:


📂 Employee Section

- employees 🏢: Stores employee details with employeeNumber as the primary key.

- offices 📍: Stores office locations, linked to employees via officeCode.

  
📂 Customer Section

- customers 🛍️: Contains customer details (customerNumber as the primary key).
  
- orders 📦: Stores purchase orders (orderNumber as the primary key).
  
- orderdetails 📜: Provides details of each order (orderNumber and productCode as a composite primary key).
  
- payments 💳: Tracks customer payments (checkNumber as the primary key).

  
📂 Product Section

- products 🏷️: Stores product details (productCode as the primary key).
  
- productlines 🏭: Categorizes products (e.g., vintage cars, motorcycles).
